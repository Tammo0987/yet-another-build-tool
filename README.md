# yabt - Yet Another Build Tool

yabt is a build tool designed to simplify the process of building Scala projects. The build definition in yabt is
defined in YAML format, providing a simple and intuitive way to configure your project settings, dependencies, and build
tasks. The main goal is to improve the speed of configuring the build and the performance of the tool itself compared to
similar tools.

## Roadmap

This is planned for now:

- **Dependency Management**: Implement features for managing transitive dependencies and conflict resolution.

- **Plugin System**: Extend yabt's functionality by seamlessly integrating custom tasks and extensions through the
  plugin system.

- **Optimized Compilation**: Introduce optimizations to speed up the compilation process and reduce build times.

- **Integrated Code Quality Tools**: Integrate popular code quality tools such as Scalafix and scalafmt for
  comprehensive code analysis and formatting.
