# yabt - Yet Another Build Tool

yabt is a build tool designed to simplify the process of building Scala projects. The build definition in yabt is
defined in YAML format, providing a simple and intuitive way to configure your project settings, dependencies, and build
tasks. The main goal is to improve the speed of configuring the build and the performance of the tool itself compared to
similar tools.

## Disclaimer
This is currently a learning project to understand build tools. If it becomes usable, then I will continue the work.

## Roadmap

This is planned for now:

- **Dependency Management**: Implement features for managing transitive dependencies and conflict resolution.

- **Plugin System**: Extend yabt's functionality by seamlessly integrating custom tasks and extensions through the
  plugin system. For example integrate popular code quality tools such as Scalafix and scalafmt for
  comprehensive code analysis and formatting.

- **Optimized Compilation**: Introduce optimizations to speed up the execution of the compilation process and reduce
  build times.
